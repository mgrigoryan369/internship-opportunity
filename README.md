# Internship Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my learning progress for the internship opportunity, including coursework, exercises, and projects.

## 📂 Folder Structure:
- `notes/` → Contains learning-progress.md where I document completed coursework
- `course-name/project` → Any exercises/projects (if applicable)

## ✅ Progress Updates
Detailed progress is tracked in `notes/learning-progress.md`.

### 🌍 Live Demo
For exercises that require a live site (e.g., API integrations or live forms), I'll deploy a demo site and share the link here.
